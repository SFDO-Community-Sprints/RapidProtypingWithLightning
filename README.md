### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
1. If we could use the Lightning Design System & Base Lightning Components for wireframing and mocking up prototypes, we could:
    1. **Improve time-to-market:** while prototyping will shorten the app / solution development lifecycle and eliminate rework, prototyping with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the same interactive library youâ€™re going to build with </span>will save more time and reduce surprises for stakeholders
    2. **Lower cost:** The Salesforce UX team has made an incredible design system - there is often no need to reinvent the wheel with expensive design resources
    3. **Achieve consistent user experience** for constituents and users interacting with your solution / program / brand
2. Ideally: the prototype library would automatically update as the actual Lightning UI library updates
*   NOTE: when building with Lightning Components, simple CSS can create differentiated and unique visual experiences. It is not expected to have this design layer at the prototyping step, just the components is enough.

### Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team accomplished during the Sprint?

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br><br>
* What is your project's Roadmap?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
