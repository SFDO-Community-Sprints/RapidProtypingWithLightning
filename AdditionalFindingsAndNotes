_OTHER NOTES AND LEARNINGS FROM TEAM RESEARCH_

In addition to the solution set above, we share additional research we completed, including our take on other platforms.  

*   Primary SF UX Git page:[https://github.com/salesforce-ux/](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/) 
*   Prototyping / Wireframe Tools Considered/ To-consider
    *   Sketch (Mac Only)- Melissa
        *   Platforms supported (Windows? Mac Only?)
            *   Mac Only
        *   Cost
            *   1 User: $99 (1st yr, decreases after)
            *   2+ Users: $89 or less (1st yr, decreases after)
        *   Functionality
            *   Modalities for design:
                *   Artboards for various UX interfaces
                    *   Lightning page
                    *   Lightning component
                    *   Desktop app
                    *   Mobile app
            *   Mobile responsive??
            *   How recent / often SLDS updated?
                *   Yes!!  Latest Release
                *   Updated by SF UX Team
            *   Does it support interactive flows
    *   Omnigraffle* (Mac Only): Rich
        *   Short answer: great tool but no easy access to SLDS
        *   It’s definitely possible to create a shared stencil with SLDS - but it does not currently exist - we’d have to make it ourselves
    *   Avonni Creator: Rich
        *   Short answer: do not recommend. Tool doesn’t pass the value-equation bar, especially for the cost of $60/mon/user
        *   It’s browser-based, with drag and drop onto an auto-snap workspace
        *   Commentary: Has the feel of a one-person operation grinding it out; not sophisticated enough to compete but too overbuilt to make up for it with simplicity
    *   Justinmind: Greg
        *   Looks very intriguing
    *   MockFlow: Greg
        *   Low-level wireframe tool
    *   Axure - not evaluated
    *   Balsamiq
        *   It is *possible* to have custom templates available and for general sharing; there is not an existing set of SLDS tools to use
    *   Gliphy - not evaluated
    *   Pencil - not evaluated
*   Initial Evaluation Criteria:
    *   Platforms supported (Windows? Mac Only?)
    *   Cost
    *   Functionality
        *   How recent / often SLDS updated?
            *   Who updates it?
        *   Modalities for design:
            *   Lightning page
            *   Lightning component
            *   Desktop & Mobile app
        *   Mobile responsive??
        *   Does it support interactive flows
        *   Collaboration Features

AVONNI CREATOR NOTES:



*   Browser based
*   Design modality for "Lightning Page"
    *   App Page
    *   Dashboard
    *   Home page
    *   Record page
    *   Email application pane
*   In-app collaboration
    *   Sharing
    *   Chat window
*   Export to Lightning Component
*   Risks:
    *   Two updates in the last year on their "What's New" blog… They did an update after Winter '19.
    *   There is no "About Us" page on their website.
    *   I don't trust it…
*   Short of it:
    *   Interaction not good enough; tool is touchy; would not recommend
    *   It's beyond the trough of disenchantment, I don't think it's the proper tool
